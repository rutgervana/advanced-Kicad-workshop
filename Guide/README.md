# Kicad advanced guide V1
By Rutger van Anrooij
## Intro
In this guide we will explore more advanced features that Kicad has to offer. 
The main feature that will be shown is the scipting interface which is included since kicad 5 by default. 
Al functions and datastructures of this python API are given in <https://docs.kicad.org/doxygen-python/namespacepcbnew.html> which can be used for future reference. 
This guide is based on the documentation of Kicad <https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-doc/blob/master/src/pcbnew/pcbnew_python_scripting.adoc> and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zVJ96SdYrs&t=1152s&ab_channel=ContextualElectronics>
The example project which we will be scripting is a WS2812B RGB LED clock powered by an ESP2812.
The main part where scripting can be very helpful is the placement of the 60 WS2812B LEDs. 
Futhermore, this guide also highlights some design considerations when using scripting within Kicad. 
## Schematic Notes 
Open the project `Kicad_workshop_volundr_clock.zip` given  with this guide, and use the unarchive function of Kicad. You can browse the schematic to view which components we will be using in our design. 
Some notes on the schematic: the design is made out of hierarchical sheets which has some advantages for sripting and using exsiting plugins. 
For instance a simple copy of a drawn layout can be copied with the duplicate shortcut (CTRL+D), however in this case the references and netnames are not updated.
For duplicating layouts where the refereces and netnames are updated we can use a sripts which need hierachical sheets to work.

## Setup and first commands
After opening PCBnew the first step to start is to use the scripting console. 
When PCBnew is open you can start it by clicking on the console button or going to Tools &rarr Scripting console.
To use the module for PCBnew we need to import it first. To import the module use the code below(very basic Python programming skils could come in handy).
    from pcbnew import * 
Now we can start using the module first we need to tell which board were working on. 
    board=GetBoard()
The PCB only has one component so far the ESP8266 which we will be moving with a some commands to a desired location and orientation.
We will be using the `GetFootprint()` function, which needs `'wxPoint' aPosition`, `'PCB_LAYER_ID' aActiveLayer` and `'bool' aVisibleOnly` as arguments.
So first save the position as a `wxPoint` which uses the internal Kicad reference of nanometers. 
We can use two methods to transform from mm to nm:`FromMM()` and `wxPointMM()` which coverses both x and y in one command. We will use the last one.
Our ESP8266 module is at coordinates (0,0) which is in the top left corner which is due to legacy conventions in coordinate systems.
In Kicad 6 the coordinate system can be changed to user preferences.
    esp8266pos=wxPointMM(0,0)   
To get the `LayerID` we will use the function `GetLayerID('wxString' aLayerName)` which takes the the layername given in the editor as argument. 
The last argument we just set as `True`, because our ESP8266 module is visible in the editor.
The footprint object can be saved so we can interact with it further.
Tying it all together.
    esp8266=board.GetFootprint(esp8266pos,GetLayerID("F.Cu"),True)
We can now use the the footprint object to change the position to somewhere in the middle of the sheet.
    esp8266.SetPosition(wxPointMM(100,100))
Nothing changes after firing the command. To see the changes also apear in the editor. 
PCBnew must be given a sign that the display must be refreshed by running `Refresh()`
## Making the script
Now that you have some basic understanding of the scripting process we will take our next to make a script.
Some things you may have noticed is that if you typed the commands themself that there is no previous command button, but there is autocomple.
For the next part we will be using some for loops to speed things up and really get scripting. To make this easier we will be using an external editor.
You can use your favorite editor. If you don't have one VScode or notepad++ are good starting positions.
- Make a file `place_leds.py` in save it in an path without spaces(for windows make a direcroy on C:blabla).
- Open it in the editor.
- Place the following code in the file.
    from pcbnew import * 
    board=GetBoard()
    esp8266pos=wxPointMM(100,100)   
    esp8266=board.GetFootprint(esp8266pos,GetLayerID("F.Cu"),True)
    esp8266.SetPosition(wxPointMM(50,50))
    Refresh()
- Save the file.
- Save the PCB and close and open the Scripting console.
- Paste the following in the scripting console `exec(open("absolute path to script").read())`(Windows: `exec(open("C://blabla/place_leds.py").read())`
Now the ESP8266 should be moved to (50,50).
Till now we have only played with one footprint, now import all footprints onto the PCB.
Getting al the needed footprints by position is not very practical so we want to get them by reference with the function `FindModuleByReference()`.
Note: there is a discrepancy between the Python API and the implementation, so `FindModuleByReference()` is used instead of `FindFootprintByReference()`
Using a for-loop we can process all the footprints we want to change.  
The below example places all the WS2812 LEDs in a circle with the correct orientation.
    import math #needed for sine/cosine
    from pcbnew import * 
    board=GetBoard()
    circle_center=wxPointMM(50,50)
    ledposition=wxPointMM(100,50)
    angle=360/60
    radius=50
    for i in range(0,60):
        LED=board.FindModuleByReference("D"+str(i+1))
        ledposition.x=circle_center.x+FromMM(radius*math.cos(math.radians(angle*i)))
        ledposition.y=circle_center.y-FromMM(radius*math.sin(math.radians(angle*i))) #minus because of coordinat system
        LED.SetPosition(ledposition)
        LED.SetOrientationDegrees(270+angle)
Ok, we have placed some LEDs. Now we want to be good Electrical Engineers and also place some decoupling capacitors at the LEDs.
This can be done in the same loop.
    import math #needed for sine/cosine
    from pcbnew import * 
    board=GetBoard()     
    circle_center=wxPointMM(50,50)
    ledposition=wxPointMM(100,50)
    capposition=wxPointMM(100,50)
    angle=360/60
    radius=50
    radius_cap=5*sqrt(2)+3
    angle_cap=45
    for i in range(0,60):
        LED=board.FindModuleByReference("D"+str(i+1))
        ledposition.x=circle_center.x+FromMM(radius*math.cos(math.radians(angle*i)))
        ledposition.y=circle_center.y-FromMM(radius*math.sin(math.radians(angle*i))) #minus because of coordinat system
        LED.SetPosition(ledposition)
        LED.SetOrientationDegrees(270+angle)
        CAP=board.FindModuleByReference("C"+str(i+1))
        capposition.x=ledposition.x+FromMM(radius_cap*math.cos(math.radians(angle*i+angle_cap))) 
        capposition.y=ledposition.y-FromMM(radius_cap*math.sin(math.radians(angle*i+angle_cap))) 
        CAP.SetPosition(cappositon) 
        CAP.SetOrientationDegrees(angle)
The final part of our script is to add tracks and vias to our layout.
- First how to make a track segment from a startpoint to an endpoint. 
    newtrack=TRACK(board) #create a trackobject
    board.Add(newtrack) #add the track to our board
    newtrack.SetNet(net) #set which net the track is
    newtrack.SetStart(startpoint) #set startpoint
    newtrack.SetEnd(endpoint) #set endpoint
    newtrack.SetWidth(net.GetNetClass().GetTrackWidth()) #set the trackwidth from our netclas
    newtrack.SetLayer(layerID) #set the layer from the layerid
- Second how to add a via to the board which is similar but slightly different
    via=VIA(board) #create new via
    board.Add(via) #add via to board
    via.SetNet(vianets) #set net of via
    via.SetWidth(vianet.GetNetClass().GetViaDiameter()) #set the net of the via
    via.SetPosition(viapoint) #set the postion of the via through a point
    via.SetViaType(VIA_THROUGH) #set viatype 
    via.SetLayerPair(0,31)#set layerpair by layerid 0=top and 31=bottom GetLayerID() can also be used

Try to finish the script by adding:
1. A track between the capacitor and the +5V pin of the WS2812B.
2. A track between the DOUT pin of the current WS2812B and DIN pin of the next WS2812B
3. A via close to the GND pin of the capacitor.
4. A track between the GND pin of the cap and the via. 
5. (optional) Change variables to the layout better.
Tip: to get the position of a pad the `GetCenter()` function can be used.
If you are stuck you can look at the final script in the project.
# Using plugins
Plugins are small script that can be used within pcbnew to speed up some actions or to extend pcbnew's functionality.
For instance pcbnew does not have capabilities to import custom copper fils. So we will use an external plugin to do this.
A Openscad script `copper_fills.scad` is used to generate the copper fill geometry. Due to the limitations on how the copper fill is generated, the outer ring needs a small gap.
The Plugin is also located in the projext folder as `DXFZonePlugin` to install it copy it to the Plugins Folder.
The location of this folder can be found in pcbnew by Preferencs &rarr Configure Paths `KICAD_PLUGIN_DIR`.
After copying it in the folder the plugin should show up in Tools &rarr External Plugins &rarr Convert a DXF to a zone after clicking refresh plugins in the same menu.
The needed DXF files are in the DXF folder of the project.
Try to get them in the pcb layout.
#Conclusion
This is the end of the workshop. Al other parts are of the pcb layout are probably not worth spending time on to script and can be routed by hand more easily.
Scripting can be a very powerful tool in the right situation and make your life easier if done right.

-Kicad can also be used as a simulator, but this is not as functionali out-of-the-box yet as non-free simulators for example Multisim.
-Schematics can also be made in a code style fashion by using a Python library <https://github.com/xesscorp/skidl>(very usefull for large number of copies of a (sub)circuit
-Producing fabricating outputs as wel as schematic prints can also be scripted.
